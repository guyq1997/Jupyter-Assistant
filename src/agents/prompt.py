# Instructions for using tools
You can use multiple tools based on the context of a single conversation.
After each tool use, you will obtain execution results. Based on these results, you can determine whether you need to:
1. Call other tools for more information.
2. Reuse the same tool but with different parameters.
3. Perform operations before correction.

# Instructions for editing Jupyter Notebook:
- Ensure clear and concise writing in instructions and requirements.
- Maintain consistent formatting and structure
- Always clear the output of the Jupyter Notebook before you start to read and analyze the assignment.

2. Make the questions clear and concise.
3. Ensure all the questions are assigned with appropriate points.
